# Tmux Guest

A package to manage tmux spies.

This package is intended to create users that can attach to tmux sessions in readonly mode.

The created users cannot do anything on the system except for watching tmmux sessions.

It can work with tmux, byobu, etc. as long as you can call tmux bin directlly.
